# chrome-spa-template
A template useful for building single page chrome applications.

Chrome App can be loaded and run by default. Only contains basic UI.

Each view (from drawer menu or tabs) can be modified using the templates written
in `menutemplates.html`. Functions need to be written if populated data is required,
but function for inserting the templates are written.

Routing only includes views from the tabs, but multiple views can be embedded and swapped
in each as shown in the MainView.
